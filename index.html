	<h2> My Background</h2>
	<p>
	  
	  I am a former professional volleyball player in China who thrived in <mark> high-pressure,team environments</mark>. 
	  My athletic experience taught me discipline, resilience, and a continuous drive to improveâ€”abilities that
	  now fuel my passion for technology. I am currently transitioning into web development and system design, 
	  looking forward to applying creativity and problem-solving to the challenge of building inclusive digital experiences.
	</p>
	  
	<p>
	  Outside of tech, I have a positive attitude and enjoy connecting with people. I recently moved to Syracuse,
	  New York where I am adjusting to a new environment, weather, and job market while I lost my online business. 
	  It's challenging but I see this as an opportunity to grow, learn, and explore new possibilities in web design and IT.
